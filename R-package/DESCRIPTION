Description: Gaussian processes are flexible distributions to model functional data. Whilst
    theoretically appealing, they are computationally cumbersome except for small datasets.
    This package implements two methods for scaling GP inference in Stan. First, a sparse
    approximation of the likelihood that is generally applicable and, second, an exact method for
    regularly spaced data modeled by stationary kernels using fast Fourier methods.
